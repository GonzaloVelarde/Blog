    Hey there! My name is Gonzalo Velarde, I am an optometrist passionate about innovation and technology.
    I have spent many years working in hospitals, specializing in the calculation of intraocular lenses. 
    Recently, I have been diving deeper into optical aberrations and visual quality, always striving to learn new techniques and explore innovative solutions to enhance patient care.
    <br><br>
    Besides my clinical experience, I am also passionate about programming and data analysis, which allows me to tackle optical challenges from a more technical perspective. 
    I find it truly exciting to combine my clinical expertise with technology, and I am constantly exploring new ways to integrate cutting-edge solutions into the field of optometry and vision science.
